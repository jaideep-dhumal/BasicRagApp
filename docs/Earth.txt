Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only one known to support life.
About 71% of Earth's surface is covered by water, primarily in the form of oceans—the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern, and Arctic—while the remaining 29% consists of land, divided into seven continents: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia.
Earth's atmosphere plays a crucial role in sustaining life; it is composed of approximately 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 0.93% argon, and 0.04% carbon dioxide, along with trace amounts of other gases.
The atmosphere not only provides oxygen for respiration but also protects the planet from harmful solar radiation and helps regulate temperature.
Earth's rich biodiversity and complex ecosystems thrive within this balance of land, water, and air, making its preservation essential for all living beings.
